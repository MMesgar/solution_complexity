If this is a wired network, verify that the network cable is properly connected and make sure the LEDs next to the network jack are properly illuminated. For example, a network card with a solid green LED or light usually indicates that the card is either connected or receiving a signal. If the green light is flashing, this is an indication of data being sent or received. In the picture to the right, is an example of LAN port with two LED indicators next to the RJ-45 port. With this port, one LED will light up if connected properly and the other will flash when transmitting data. If there are no lights or the lights are orange or red .  the card may be bad, not connected properly, or that the card is not receiving a signal from the network. If you are on a small or local network and have the capability of checking a hub , switch , or router verify that the cables are properly connected and that it has power. If after checking the connections the LED indicators appear bad, the network adapter, port, or cable may be defective. Wireless Network .  If you're using a laptop with a wireless network make sure if the laptop has a Wi-Fi button that it is turned on. Many laptops will have a Wi-Fi button that allows the wireless network to be turned on and off. In the picture to the right, is an example of a Wi-Fi button that is currently enabled. If the Wi-Fi button is turned on, make sure you're connecting to the correct Wi-Fi hotspot by right-clicking on the Network icon in the Windows notification area and clicking "Connect to a network". Usually, the network with the strongest connection (the most bars) will be your wireless router. Finally, when connecting to most wireless networks you will need to enter the proper SSID (password) in order to connect to the network. If the incorrect SSID has been entered you will be denied access to the network.

If you receive an error or if the transmission fails the network card is not physically installed into the computer correctly, has the incorrect drivers, or that the card is bad.	1	Verify connections .  Wired Network .  If this is a wired network, verify that the network cable is properly connected and make sure the LEDs next to the network jack are properly illuminated. For example, a network card with a solid green LED or light usually indicates that the card is either connected or receiving a signal. If the green light is flashing, this is an indication of data being sent or received. In the picture to the right, is an example of LAN port with two LED indicators next to the RJ-45 port. With this port, one LED will light up if connected properly and the other will flash when transmitting data. If there are no lights or the lights are orange or red .  the card may be bad, not connected properly, or that the card is not receiving a signal from the network. If you are on a small or local network and have the capability of checking a hub , switch , or router verify that the cables are properly connected and that it has power. If after checking the connections the LED indicators appear bad, the network adapter, port, or cable may be defective. Wireless Network .  If you're using a laptop with a wireless network make sure if the laptop has a Wi-Fi button that it is turned on. Many laptops will have a Wi-Fi button that allows the wireless network to be turned on and off. In the picture to the right, is an example of a Wi-Fi button that is currently enabled. If the Wi-Fi button is turned on, make sure you're connecting to the correct Wi-Fi hotspot by right-clicking on the Network icon in the Windows notification area and clicking "Connect to a network". Usually, the network with the strongest connection (the most bars) will be your wireless router. Finally, when connecting to most wireless networks you will need to enter the proper SSID (password) in order to connect to the network. If the incorrect SSID has been entered you will be denied access to the network.

Turn off the power to the computer and leave it off. Unplug the power to your router and cable modem or DSL modem . Leave the power cables disconnected for 10-15 seconds and then plug in your modem and then your router again. Finally, turn on your computer again and repeat this step to see if you can ping your router.   If after following the above steps the Internet is still not working, open the Windows command line and run the below command. Running the above command should get a reply from Google. If you get a reply, this is an indication that the Internet is working, but you may be encountering a problem with the Internet browser you are using to browse the Internet. Try an alternative browser such as Firefox or Chrome . If you're getting no reply from Google, your router or modem is not reaching the Internet. If you have a router, make sure your router has DHCP enabled and that the WAN or Gateway address is the proper ISP address. Finally, after verifying all of the above settings if your Internet is still not working we suggest contacting the ISP to make sure it is not a problem on their end and to assist you further with any special configurations that may not be mentioned in this document.

Another method of determining network issues is to use the tracert command if you are a Windows user or the traceroute command if you are a Linux or Unix variant user. This command will give you an overview of each of the devices (routers) a packet travels ( hops ) over a network and can give you an idea of where a problem exists in your network or outside of your network. To use this command you must be at the command line and type one of the below commands depending on your operating system. or .  If run successfully you should begin to see each hop between the computer and network devices. When the connection fails, determine what device is causing the issue by reviewing the traceroute listing.

If the printer has paper in the paper tray, the paper may be jammed or not feeding properly. Take the paper out of the paper tray and check to see that the top piece of paper is not crinkled or bent. If the printer is a DeskJet, lift open the front cover and look to see if a piece of paper is halfway fed through. If it is, remove paper gently from the top and close. If the printer is a LaserJet, open the top of the printer and check for paper underneath the toner cartridge. If there is paper there, gently remove it, and replace the toner cartridge.

Check to make sure the power cord is plugged in both to the wall or power strip and to the back of the printer. Wiggle the power cord where it plugs into the back of the printer to make sure it is not loose. Some models of desk jets have a two part power cord. In this case, check along the length of the power cord to make sure both parts are plugged in together. If the printer is still not getting power, plug the power cord into a different outlet on the power strip. If this does not work, try plugging the printer into a different wall outlet.

The computer and the printer must be communicating before the printer will print. When you send a document to print, does a small printer appear on the Windows taskbar (down by the time)? If this printer appears on the taskbar, the computer thinks the printer is receiving communication. At this point, the printer should blink lights (if a DeskJet) or says "printing" or "receiving" on the display (if a laser printer). If the printer is not receiving the communication from the computer, try restarting the computer. After you have logged in, see if you can print now.

Security updates and patches are applied, programs are installed and uninstalled, and settings are modified regularly. It is therefore a good idea to wipe the hard drive and reinstall Windows from scratch, back to its optimum configuration and performance. Doing this after around three to four years of use may give a noticeable speed improvement. When reinstalling Windows from scratch, it is important to backup any data you have stored on the hard drive, as well as making a note of the programs you would like reinstalled. Please speak to a member of DIDE IT if you think the time has come for your machine to be wiped and setup with a fresh installation of Windows (which will normally be the latest version of Windows).

Security updates and patches are applied, programs are installed and uninstalled, and settings are modified regularly. It is therefore a good idea to wipe the hard drive and reinstall Windows from scratch, back to its optimum configuration and performance. Doing this after around three to four years of use may give a noticeable speed improvement. When reinstalling Windows from scratch, it is important to backup any data you have stored on the hard drive, as well as making a note of the programs you would like reinstalled. Please speak to a member of DIDE IT if you think the time has come for your machine to be wiped and setup with a fresh installation of Windows (which will normally be the latest version of Windows).

Security updates and patches are applied, programs are installed and uninstalled, and settings are modified regularly. It is therefore a good idea to wipe the hard drive and reinstall Windows from scratch, back to its optimum configuration and performance. Doing this after around three to four years of use may give a noticeable speed improvement. When reinstalling Windows from scratch, it is important to backup any data you have stored on the hard drive, as well as making a note of the programs you would like reinstalled. Please speak to a member of DIDE IT if you think the time has come for your machine to be wiped and setup with a fresh installation of Windows (which will normally be the latest version of Windows).

Security updates and patches are applied, programs are installed and uninstalled, and settings are modified regularly. It is therefore a good idea to wipe the hard drive and reinstall Windows from scratch, back to its optimum configuration and performance. Doing this after around three to four years of use may give a noticeable speed improvement. When reinstalling Windows from scratch, it is important to backup any data you have stored on the hard drive, as well as making a note of the programs you would like reinstalled. Please speak to a member of DIDE IT if you think the time has come for your machine to be wiped and setup with a fresh installation of Windows (which will normally be the latest version of Windows).

Security updates and patches are applied, programs are installed and uninstalled, and settings are modified regularly. It is therefore a good idea to wipe the hard drive and reinstall Windows from scratch, back to its optimum configuration and performance. Doing this after around three to four years of use may give a noticeable speed improvement. When reinstalling Windows from scratch, it is important to backup any data you have stored on the hard drive, as well as making a note of the programs you would like reinstalled. Please speak to a member of DIDE IT if you think the time has come for your machine to be wiped and setup with a fresh installation of Windows (which will normally be the latest version of Windows).

Warning: Make sure you create a full backup of your registry first in case you need to revert a change made by a registry cleaner: Manually disable programs from starting up when Windows starts up using the msconfig utility. Click on Start -> Run (or just Start in Vista/7), type in msconfig and press return. Click on the Startup tab to view a list or programs that starts up when Windows does. Uncheck the box next to all the programs you don't want to startup automatically:	10	Reinstall Windows Windows can become slow and develop problems after years of use on the same machine. Security updates and patches are applied, programs are installed and uninstalled, and settings are modified regularly. It is therefore a good idea to wipe the hard drive and reinstall Windows from scratch, back to its optimum configuration and performance. Doing this after around three to four years of use may give a noticeable speed improvement. When reinstalling Windows from scratch, it is important to backup any data you have stored on the hard drive, as well as making a note of the programs you would like reinstalled. Please speak to a member of DIDE IT if you think the time has come for your machine to be wiped and setup with a fresh installation of Windows (which will normally be the latest version of Windows).

Check the connection to your computer, the modem, and to any hub, router, or wireless base station you may be using. Try swapping your cable with another to rule out any faulty cable issues. If you're connecting wirelessly, make sure that the wireless network is up and running and that you actually have access to that network—you may need a password or need to be added to an access control list by your MAC address (aka AirPort ID). For more information about joining an encrypted wireless network, see AirPort, Time Capsule: Joining an encrypted wireless network. If you connect to the Internet using a corporate or enterprise network (such as if you're at work) and can't access certain webpages or sites, the network may have a firewall that is preventing you from doing so.

Check the connection to your computer, the modem, and to any hub, router, or wireless base station you may be using. Try swapping your cable with another to rule out any faulty cable issues. If you're connecting wirelessly, make sure that the wireless network is up and running and that you actually have access to that network—you may need a password or need to be added to an access control list by your MAC address (aka AirPort ID). For more information about joining an encrypted wireless network, see AirPort, Time Capsule: Joining an encrypted wireless network. If you connect to the Internet using a corporate or enterprise network (such as if you're at work) and can't access certain webpages or sites, the network may have a firewall that is preventing you from doing so. Contact your network administrator for more information and assistance.

Check the connection to your computer, the modem, and to any hub, router, or wireless base station you may be using. Try swapping your cable with another to rule out any faulty cable issues. If you're connecting wirelessly, make sure that the wireless network is up and running and that you actually have access to that network—you may need a password or need to be added to an access control list by your MAC address (aka AirPort ID). For more information about joining an encrypted wireless network, see AirPort, Time Capsule: Joining an encrypted wireless network. If you connect to the Internet using a corporate or enterprise network (such as if you're at work) and can't access certain webpages or sites, the network may have a firewall that is preventing you from doing so. Contact your network administrator for more information and assistance.	5	Check your network status From the Apple menu, choose System Preferences and then click Network to display Network preferences. The status indicator for each port is color-coded. Green means the port is active (turned on) and connected. Red indicates the port is active but not connected. Make sure that the status indicator of the port through which your computer accesses the Internet is green. (With earlier Mac OS X versions, from the "Show" pop-up menu, choose Network Status to check the status of your network ports. If you don't see your port, make it active by choosing Network Port Configurations from the Show pop-up menu and selecting the appropriate checkbox for your connection.)

For more information, consult the documentation that came with your product or choose your computer from the pop-up menu under “Installing DIY Parts” on the Do It Yourself Parts & Service page to find instructions (in PDF format) for installing AirPort cards and memory into your computer. If you still can't turn on your computer, remove your new addition (and replace it with the original if needed) to see if your computer starts up. If it does, contact the device's manufacturer for assistance.

The networking software picks the connection with the best performance. If connection A has Internet connectivity but slow performance and connection B has no Internet connectivity but better local network performance, the networking software will route network traffic over connection B. This means that you won't be able to view websites, so the networking icon and the network diagram in Network and Sharing Center will report that you only have local connectivity (no Internet). This is correct, but it's not what you want. To force your computer to use connection A—the connection with Internet connectivity—disconnect connection B and try again.
