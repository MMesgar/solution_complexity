18	ch000528	0	Regaining computer hard drive space	Microsoft Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista and 7 users .  Run the Disk Cleanup option .  Open My Computer . Right-click on the hard drive that you wish to regain hard drive space. For example, right-click on the C: drive. Click Properties. Within the General tab , click the "Disk Cleanup" button located next to the pie chart . Windows will scan the computer for all files available to clean up. Once in the Disk Cleanup window check each of the boxes (except "compress old files") that are taking disk space and click Ok and then Yes if you wish to proceed. Compress? When performing a Disk Cleanup you'll have an option to compress your hard drive. We strongly recommend users do not compress their hard drive or compress their old files. Uninstall old programs or games no longer used .  Uninstalling Windows software. Disable System Restore .  Windows XP, Vista, and 7 users can also decrease the default space utilized by Windows System Restore and often gain several additional gigabytes of hard drive space. See the below steps in customizing this feature. Click Start, Programs, Accessories, System Tools, and open System Restore . Within the System Restore window, click System Restore Settings . Within the System Restore tab you can either check the Turn off System Restore on all drives to completely disable this feature, or click the Settings button and decrease the space usage, which is what we would recommend. Additional suggestion for Windows 2000 and Windows XP users: Window 2000 and Windows XP keeps all the necessary files needed to uninstall any of the updates ever installed on your computer. Often this is several dozen updates that can take up several hundred and sometimes over 1 gig of space on your hard drive. What are the $NtUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders in Windows?

248	microsoft.txt	2	Why did the wrong channel record?	Windows Media Center might have attempted to tune to a channel that is not part of your TV service package. In some cases, the automatic behavior of some set-top boxes affects how Windows Media Center can control the set-top box. When Windows Media Center tunes to a channel that is not part of your TV service package, the set-top box might instead change to a default channel, display an on-screen message, remain on the last viewed channel, or change to the closest viewable channel in the listings. In all cases, the set-top box performs a default action that causes Windows Media Center to get out of sync and record the wrong channel. You can prevent Windows Media Center from trying to access and record channels that you do not subscribe to by hiding unwanted channels. To hide channels that are not included in your TV service package On the start screen, scroll to Tasks, click settings, click TV, click Guide, and then click Edit Channels. Use the arrow buttons on the screen to scroll through the list and locate the channels that you want to show or hide. As you click each channel, the inset window displays that channel. Select or clear the check box next to each channel. When a check box is selected, the channel appears in the Guide; when a check box is cleared, the channel does not appear.

271	microsoft.txt	0	Why did the FM radio stop playing unexpectedly?	Tuner hardware that may be included in your computer can have an FM radio input as well as an input for TV signal. In some cases, that type of tuner hardware cannot receive FM radio at the same time as it receives a TV signal. For example, if the tuner is in use for FM radio when Windows Media Center is scheduled to start a recording, a warning appears that the FM radio session will be stopped when the TV recording starts. If you do not make a selection, Windows Media Center automatically stops FM radio and begins recording TV, as scheduled.
