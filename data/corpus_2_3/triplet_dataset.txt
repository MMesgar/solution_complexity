1	240	Your computer is too far from the wireless router or access point.	0	With 802.11b or 802.11g routers and access points, the maximum range is up to 150 feet (46 meters) indoors and 300 feet (92 meters) outdoors. With 802.11a routers and access points, the maximum range is 50 feet (15 meters) indoors and 100 feet (30 meters) outdoors. These ranges are in optimal conditions with no interference. Make sure that your computer is within this range and as close as possible to the router or access point. If the computer is portable, try moving it around to determine the range of the wireless signal and the best place to put the computer.	1	If you are unable to get closer to the router or access point, you might want to consider buying and installing an external antenna to your wireless network adapter. Many wireless network adapters are set up so that you can attach an external antenna to them, which will provide you with better reception than the built-in antenna. Check the information that came with your wireless network adapter to see if you can install an additional antenna.

1	290	I added my scanner to the computer but I can't select it when I use Windows Fax and Scan or Windows Photo Gallery.	0	Make sure that you've correctly connected the scanner or multifunction printer with scanning capabilities to your computer, and that the device is powered on. If that doesn't work, you might need to update the driver so that your scanner can work with this version of Windows. For more information, see Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly.	1	If a driver is not available or if you've updated the driver and still can't select the scanner, find out if your scanner uses TWAIN technology. TWAIN is an application programming interface (API) that is used to import images from scanners and digital cameras to your computer. Windows Photo Gallery and Windows Fax and Scan use a different technology, called the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) API, and do not work with TWAIN scanners. If your scanner uses TWAIN technology, you might need to use the program that came with your scanner instead of using Windows Fax and Scan or Windows Photo Gallery. To find out if your scanner uses TWAIN technology, check the information that came with the scanner or contact the scanner manufacturer.

1	291	I tried putting more than one picture on the scanner at one time and scanning each of them to a separate file, but it doesn't work.	0	Make sure that there's enough space between the pictures before you try to scan them. For example, if you place multiple photos on a scanner, make sure that the pictures are separated from each other on all sides before you try to scan them at one time into separate files. If that doesn't work, you might need to scan each picture separately.	1	Some scanners do not support image segmentation, which is the ability to preview or scan multiple images at one time and then create separate files for each image. For more information, contact the scanner manufacturer.
