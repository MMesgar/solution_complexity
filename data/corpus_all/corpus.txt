1	ch000179	1	My computer is running slow what steps can I do to fix it?	Background programs .  One of the most common reasons for a slow computer are programs running in the background. Remove or disable any TSRs and startup programs that automatically start each time the computer boots. Tip: To see what programs are running in the background and how much memory and CPU they are using open Task Manager .  If you are running Windows 7 or higher run Resmon to get a better understanding of how your computer is being used. If you've got an antivirus scanner on the computer, spyware protection program, or other security utility make sure it's not scanning your computer in the background. If a scan is in progress it can decrease the overall performance of your computer.	background program .#@#one of the most common reason for a slow computer be program run in the background .#@#remove or disable any tsr and startup program that automatically start each time the computer boot .#@#tip : to see what program be run in the background and how much memory and CPU they be use open Task Manager .#@#if you be run Windows 7 or higher run resmon to get a better understanding of how you computer be be use .#@#if you have get a antivirus scanner on the computer , spyware protection program , or other security utility make sure it be not scan you computer in the background .#@#if a scan be in progress it can decrease the overall performance of you computer .

2	ch000223	0	How to fix a fatal exception error	Search for the error .  Often the easiest and fastest method to locate the cause of a fatal exception is to search for the error. However, for some users it may be difficult to know exactly what to search for because of the cryptic fatal exception messages. Below are tips on how to search for these errors. As mentioned above the fatal exception will often have a two character code, for example 0E, if this code is present use this as part of your search. Next, the error message will contain a pointer such as "0028:c001e36", although this can often be found by also adding this to your search query it's important to realize that this pointer can vary from computer to computer. If you're not finding results exclude this from your search. Finally, many fatal exception error messages will also contain a file that generated the error, almost always this is a VXD file. If the fatal exception error contains a .VXD definitely include this as part of your search. The VXD file may also be listed as "VXD VWIN32", which is "vwin32.vxd".

2	ch000223	3	How to fix a fatal exception error	Hardware drivers .  If you are getting a fatal exception when using a hardware device, for example, when you print. It's likely that it's the drivers related to that device that are either conflicting or have errors. Video drivers are also notorious for causing fatal exception error messages. Because your video card is being used all the time it's difficult to know for certain if it's the cause of the error. Therefore we always recommend users have the latest video drivers on their computer. Visit the manufacturers web page and get the latest software and drivers from them.

6	ch000241	2	No display on the monitor	Connections not connected properly .  Make sure that you are connecting the monitor to the back of the computer in the 15-pin connector as shown to the right or older computer 9-pin connection. If the computer is properly plugged in, make sure it's getting getting power. If you are not receiving power from a known working wall outlet and if the power cord is removable, replace it with the one connected to the computer and power on the monitor again. If the monitor still does not get power or it is not removable, it is recommended that the monitor be replaced or serviced at a local TV or computer repair shop. If the monitor is receiving power, check the status light. If the light is orange or flashing ensure that the monitor is not in a suspend mode by moving the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard. If the computer does not get a display by moving the mouse or touching the keyboard, turn off the computer and monitor and reconnect the data cable from the back of the computer, and if removable, the back of the monitor.

8	ch000208	1	Missing or lost sound in Windows	Verify the installed driver settings .  Open the Windows Device Manager .  Verify there are no conflicts or errors listed anywhere in Device Manager. If conflicts exist skip down to conflicts section . Verify no other devices are listed. If other devices are listed skip down to other devices section . Verify that your "Sound, video and game controllers" category is listed, if not skip down to the missing sound card section . If no conflicts or other devices are listed and your sound card is listed with no conflicts, skip to the next section . Conflicts section .  If conflicts exists with your sound card or other devices installed in your computer it is likely that either the drivers are not properly installed for that device or the sound card or other devices are conflicting. If you open the properties of the device that is conflicting and view the properties, additional details about the conflict can be found. Additional information about error codes as well as help with Device Manager can be found on our Device Manager section . If you are unable to locate additional information about your issue or are unable to resolve the issue, follow the below steps. Under Sound, Video and game controllers highlight each device and press the delete key to remove the device. Reboot the computer. As the computer is booting the system will detect the sound card and any of it's devices and re-install those devices. If prompted for a location of drivers, try pointing it to your sound card CD or your Windows CD. If this does not work or is unable to locate the proper files, you will need to get the latest sound drivers from your sound card manufacturer. Other devices section .  If other devices are listed, it is possible that these other devices could be the sound card or other devices conflicting with the sound card. If any other devices are listed it is recommended you remove those devices, reboot the computer and let Windows redetect the devices. If this does not work, determine what device is not being detected and resolve that issue first. Missing sound card section. If you are missing the "Sound, video and game controllers" category in Device Manager, it is likely that the sound card drivers are not installed properly, sound card has been disabled, sound card is bad, or no sound card is available in the computer. First, verify no conflicts or other devices are present in the Device Manager; if these are present it is likely they are the sound card or devices causing the sound card not to be detected. Second, verify that the computer has a sound card and that the sound card is enabled on the computer. If this is an on-board sound card you can verify that it is enabled in CMOS setup . If you have no adapters or cannot click the down arrow to select the correct adapter, close out of this Window. In Control Panel double-click the System icon, click the Device Manager tab within Device Manager and ensure there are no yellow ! or red X. If you have either of these on any of your sound devices, remove everything under Sound Video game controllers and reboot the computer. If after rebooting the computer you still have the same conflicts, double-click on the conflicting device and refer to our Device Manager error code section giving you additional information on the error code you are experiencing.	verify the install driver setting .#@#open the Windows Device Manager .#@#verify there be no conflict or error list anywhere in Device Manager .#@#if conflict exist skip down to conflict section .#@#verify no other device be list .#@#if other device be list skip down to other device section .#@#verify that you `` sound , video and game controller '' category be list , if not skip down to the miss sound card section .#@#if no conflict or other device be list and you sound card be list with no conflict , skip to the next section .#@#conflict section .#@#if conflict exist with you sound card or other device install in you computer it be likely that either the driver be not properly install for that device or the sound card or other device be conflict .#@#if you open the property of the device that be conflict and view the property , additional detail about the conflict can be find .#@#additional information about error code as well as help with Device Manager can be find on we Device Manager section .#@#if you be unable to locate additional information about you issue or be unable to resolve the issue , follow the below step .#@#under sound , Video and game controller highlight each device and press the delete key to remove the device .#@#reboot the computer .#@#as the computer be boot the system will detect the sound card and any of it be device and re-install those device .#@#if prompt for a location of driver , try point it to you sound card cd or you Windows CD .#@#if this do not work or be unable to locate the proper file , you will need to get the latest sound driver from you sound card manufacturer .#@#other device section .#@#if other device be list , it be possible that these other device could be the sound card or other device conflict with the sound card .#@#if any other device be list it be recommend you remove those device , reboot the computer and let Windows redetect the device .#@#if this do not work , determine what device be not be detect and resolve that issue first .#@#miss sound card section .#@#if you be miss the `` sound , video and game controller '' category in Device Manager , it be likely that the sound card driver be not install properly , sound card have be disabled , sound card be bad , or no sound card be available in the computer .#@#first , verify no conflict or other device be present in the Device Manager ; if these be present it be likely they be the sound card or device cause the sound card not to be detect .#@#second , verify that the computer have a sound card and that the sound card be enable on the computer .#@#if this be a on-board sound card you can verify that it be enable in CMOS setup .#@#if you have no adapter or can not click the down arrow to select the correct adapter , close out of this window .#@#in Control Panel double-click the System icon , click the Device Manager tab within Device Manager and ensure there be no yellow !#@#or red x .#@#if you have either of these on any of you sound device , remove everything under sound Video game controller and reboot the computer .#@#if after reboot the computer you still have the same conflict , double-click on the conflict device and refer to we Device Manager error code section give you additional information on the error code you be experience .

If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer. You can first start by verifying the fan on the power supply is working by examining the back of the computer and seeing if the fan is moving and moving smoothly. For all other fans in the computer you will need to either open the computer and make sure the fan are working ( processor fan and case fan) or if the computer monitors the RPM of the fans, enter CMOS setup and make sure the BIOS does not report any errors. Users may also be able to determine how hot their computer is by onboard thermal sensors. If your computer comes equipped with these sensors, make sure your CPU is not running too hot.

9	ch000690	4	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently	Hardware issue .  Caution: Some of the below steps require you open your computer. While in the computer, be cautious of ESD . In addition to software, hardware can also cause a computer to lock. If you have recently added any new hardware into the computer, temporarily remove it to make sure it is not the cause of your issue. Before attempting to remove any hardware, make sure the computer has no conflicts in Device Manager . If you have not recently installed any new hardware into the computer, the next best solution to determining if this is a hardware issue would be remove any hardware on the computer that is not needed. For example, remove your modem, network card, sound card, and any other expansion cards that are not needed for the computer to operate. Run the computer without these cards to see if they are the cause of your issue.	hardware issue .#@#caution : some of the below step require you open you computer .#@#while in the computer , be cautious of esd .#@#in addition to software , hardware can also cause a computer to lock .#@#if you have recently add any new hardware into the computer , temporarily remove it to make sure it be not the cause of you issue .#@#before attempt to remove any hardware , make sure the computer have no conflict in Device Manager .#@#if you have not recently install any new hardware into the computer , the next best solution to determine if this be a hardware issue would be remove any hardware on the computer that be not need .#@#for example , remove you modem , network card , sound card , and any other expansion card that be not need for the computer to operate .#@#Run the computer without these card to see if they be the cause of you issue .

13	ch000726	0	Not a valid Win32 application	File is corrupt, bad, or missing .  If the file or program you're attempting to run is corrupt or missing, Windows will be unable to execute the file properly and sometimes generate this error message. Download files .  If you downloaded this file and verified it is complete and compatible with your version of Windows , delete the file and try downloading and running it again. It's possible during the download that the file became corrupted. Finally, if the second download does not work, try downloading the file from a different webpage. It is possible that the person or company maintaining the website mistakenly uploaded a corrupt version of the file you're attempting download. Installing a program from a CD or other disk .  If you're attempting to install a program and are getting this error, verify that the CD is clean . If the CD is dirty or bad, you could get this error during the install or after the program has been installed because it was not copied properly onto the computer. Running a program from the computer .  If you're running the program from a shortcut on the computer, verify that the program is still on the computer. In some cases if the program is no longer installed on the computer you may get this error. If the hard drive is corrupted or bad it can also cause working programs to fail either because not all the data can be read from the hard drive or because the program has become corrupted while on the drive. Run scandisk and defrag on the hard drive to check for any potential errors. Long file name issue .  Make sure the program or file you're attempting to run does not contain the same name as the long file name directory it is contained in. For example, executing a file named "program" in the "program files" directory can cause errors in some versions of Windows. Additionally, if you're attempting to install a program and after the install the program does not work, you may also want to try installing the program in a different directory . Bad file .  Any file can be changed or renamed to be a .exe file. If you're downloading the file, make sure the file is supposed to be a .exe file and that it's not being changed. If you're attempting to create a .exe, file make sure you're compiling the file for Windows and never just rename a file to a .exe file. For example, renaming a .bat file to a .exe file will not make the file an executable file. For a file to become an executable file it needs to either be compiled or converted through a software program designed to convert the file.	file be corrupt , bad , or miss .#@#if the file or program you be attempt to run be corrupt or missing , Windows will be unable to execute the file properly and sometimes generate this error message .#@#download file .#@#if you download this file and verify it be complete and compatible with you version of Windows , delete the file and try downloading and run it again .#@#it be possible during the download that the file become corrupt .#@#finally , if the second download do not work , try download the file from a different webpage .#@#it be possible that the person or company maintain the website mistakenly upload a corrupt version of the file you be attempt download .#@#install a program from a cd or other disk .#@#if you be attempt to install a program and be get this error , verify that the CD be clean .#@#if the CD be dirty or bad , you could get this error during the install or after the program have be install because it be not copy properly onto the computer .#@#run a program from the computer .#@#if you be run the program from a shortcut on the computer , verify that the program be still on the computer .#@#in some case if the program be no longer install on the computer you may get this error .#@#if the hard drive be corrupt or bad it can also cause work program to fail either because not all the datum can be read from the hard drive or because the program have become corrupt while on the drive .#@#Run scandisk and defrag on the hard drive to check for any potential error .#@#long file name issue .#@#make sure the program or file you be attempt to run do not contain the same name as the long file name directory it be contain in .#@#for example , execute a file name `` program '' in the `` program file '' directory can cause error in some version of Windows .#@#additionally , if you be attempt to install a program and after the install the program do not work , you may also want to try install the program in a different directory .#@#bad file .#@#any file can be change or rename to be a .#@#exe file .#@#if you be download the file , make sure the file be suppose to be a .#@#exe file and that it be not be change .#@#if you be attempt to create a .#@#exe , file make sure you be compile the file for Windows and never just rename a file to a .#@#exe file .#@#for example , rename a .#@#bat file to a .#@#exe file will not make the file a executable file .#@#for a file to become a executable file it need to either be compile or convert through a software program design to convert the file .

14	ch000605	0	Windows restarts without warning	Software issue or error .  With the introduction of Windows XP Microsoft designed Windows to automatically reboot each time an error occurs such as a BSoD . Although this may be nice for errors that do not occur often, users who have a re-occurring error may wish to identify the error to troubleshoot it. Below are the steps on how this feature can be disabled and enabled in Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. From the Desktop .  right-click on My Computer . Click the Properties option. In the System Properties window click the Advanced .  tab or the Advanced system settings link. In Advanced click the Settings .  button under Startup and Recovery . In the Startup and Recovery window uncheck the Automatically restart check box. Click Ok. Now if the computer generates an error it should not automatically restart and should display an error message, most likely a BSoD. How do I fix the Windows blue screen errors?

14	ch000605	1	Windows restarts without warning	Hardware issue or error .  Caution: Some of the below steps require you open your computer. While in the computer, be cautious of ESD . Any failing hardware component in your computer could cause your computer to unexpectedly generate an error or reboot without warning. If you have recently attempted to add a new hardware device, remove that device to make sure it is not causing your issues. Make sure you are not encountering any hardware conflicts by viewing Device Manager for errors . New drivers can also cause this issue, if you have recently performed any hardware driver updates you may wish to try an earlier version of the drivers. Additional information and help with computer drivers can be found on our drivers page . If you have updated drivers and removed any hardware that could be causing this issue and continue to experience random reboots, it's possible that the memory is bad in the computer. How can I test my memory to determine if it is bad? Finally, hardware devices that are not installed properly in the computer can also cause random reboots. Make sure all the cables and expansion cards are connected properly to the computer.

14	ch000605	3	Windows restarts without warning	Heat related issue .  Many computer today are designed to turn off or automatically reboot if the computer, processor, or other device in your computer gets to hot. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer. First, verify the fan on the power supply is working by examining the back of the computer and seeing if the fan is moving and moving smoothly. For all other fans in the computer you will need to either open the computer and verify all fans are working, e.g. processor fan and case fan. Tip: If your BIOS monitors the RPM of the fans enter CMOS Setup and verify it does not report any errors. What temperature should my processor be running at?	heat related issue .#@#many computer today be design to turn off or automatically reboot if the computer , processor , or other device in you computer get to hot .#@#if you have hear any abnormal noise come from you computer recently such as a high squeal this could indicate a fan may be fail in you computer .#@#first , verify the fan on the power supply be work by examine the back of the computer and see if the fan be move and move smoothly .#@#for all other fan in the computer you will need to either open the computer and verify all fan be work , e.g. processor fan and case fan .#@#tip : if you bio monitor the rpm of the fan enter CMOS Setup and verify it do not report any error .#@#what temperature should my processor be run at ?

15	ch000749	3	Missing Microsoft Windows .dll files	Issue with .dll files only with a specific program .  If you're encountering the missing, corrupt, or other errors relating to .dll files only when you open or run a program, it's likely an issue with that program. Resolving program-specific errors can be much easier than operating system related .dll errors. If the program you're attempting to run has worked in the past on your computer and has only recently started to get the .dll errors, reinstalling the program generating the errors will almost always resolve your problem. Additionally, while reinstalling the program, it's also a good idea to check if updates or patches have been made available by the developer of your program.

18	ch000528	0	Regaining computer hard drive space	Microsoft Windows 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista and 7 users .  Run the Disk Cleanup option .  Open My Computer . Right-click on the hard drive that you wish to regain hard drive space. For example, right-click on the C: drive. Click Properties. Within the General tab , click the "Disk Cleanup" button located next to the pie chart . Windows will scan the computer for all files available to clean up. Once in the Disk Cleanup window check each of the boxes (except "compress old files") that are taking disk space and click Ok and then Yes if you wish to proceed. Compress? When performing a Disk Cleanup you'll have an option to compress your hard drive. We strongly recommend users do not compress their hard drive or compress their old files. Uninstall old programs or games no longer used .  Uninstalling Windows software. Disable System Restore .  Windows XP, Vista, and 7 users can also decrease the default space utilized by Windows System Restore and often gain several additional gigabytes of hard drive space. See the below steps in customizing this feature. Click Start, Programs, Accessories, System Tools, and open System Restore . Within the System Restore window, click System Restore Settings . Within the System Restore tab you can either check the Turn off System Restore on all drives to completely disable this feature, or click the Settings button and decrease the space usage, which is what we would recommend. Additional suggestion for Windows 2000 and Windows XP users: Window 2000 and Windows XP keeps all the necessary files needed to uninstall any of the updates ever installed on your computer. Often this is several dozen updates that can take up several hundred and sometimes over 1 gig of space on your hard drive. What are the $NtUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders in Windows?

19	ch000248	0	General printer troubleshooting	Printer does not have power indicator .  First, make sure that the printer is on. When a printer is on it should have some light (usually green) indicating it's receiving power and is on. If you do not have any indicator light make sure the printer is connected to a working power outlet by verifying each end of the power cable. Next, press the printer power button.

19	ch000248	2	General printer troubleshooting	Printer error (orange or blinking light) After your printer has completed its initial startup you should have a solid green light. If the light indicator is blinking or orange often this is an indication of a printer error. For example, this could indicate a paper jam, issue with the ink or toner cartridge, or other serious error. Because there is no standard to what a blinking light or orange light means if you're getting either of these we suggest referring to the printer documentation for troubleshooting steps or methods of determining what the status indicator is reporting.	printer error -lrb- orange or blinking light -rrb- after you printer have complete its initial startup you should have a solid green light .#@#if the light indicator be blinking or orange often this be a indication of a printer error .#@#for example , this could indicate a paper jam , issue with the ink or toner cartridge , or other serious error .#@#because there be no standard to what a blinking light or orange light means if you be get either of these we suggest refer to the printer documentation for troubleshoot step or method of determine what the status indicator be report .

19	ch000248	5	General printer troubleshooting	Printer self tests .  Most printers have a way of printing a test page. This page allows you to determine if the printer is physically working or not. This test is usually accomplished by holding down a series of keys. If you are not sure if your printer has this feature or how to perform it refer to your manual or visit your printer manufacturers web site . In addition to testing the printer using the printer self-test Microsoft Windows users can also perform a software self-test to determine if their computer is able to see the printer and it's able to print. Follow the below steps to perform this test. Microsoft Windows 98, 2000, ME, XP, 2003, and Vista users .  Click Start , Settings, and open Control Panel . Double-click the Printers or Printers and Fax icon. Right-click on the Printer you wish to test and click Properties. If you do not see your printer listed your printer is not installed. In the Printers Properties window click the Print Test Page button . If the printer is able to print a test page, you're printer is installed and setup properly. However, if you're unable to print in other programs it's possible that the program you're attempting to print from has issues. Older versions of Windows with older printers .  If you are running an older printer and MS-DOS , Windows 3.x , Windows 95 , Windows 98 , or Windows NT , you can also attempt the below software test. Get to a MS-DOS prompt or Windows command line .  Get to the root directory - Type: cd\ Reroute dir to printer - Type: dir > lpt1 .  The above should take the directory listing and print to the printer. If this does not print, refer to your operating system troubleshooting section. Extra Note: This will not paper feed, therefore press your FF or PP, or manually eject the paper.	printer self test .#@#most printer have a way of print a test page .#@#this page allow you to determine if the printer be physically work or not .#@#this test be usually accomplish by hold down a series of key .#@#if you be not sure if you printer have this feature or how to perform it refer to you manual or visit you printer manufacturer web site .#@#in addition to test the printer use the printer self-test Microsoft Windows user can also perform a software self-test to determine if they computer be able to see the printer and it be able to print .#@#follow the below step to perform this test .#@#Microsoft Windows 98 , 2000 , me , xp , 2003 , and Vista user .#@#click Start , Settings , and open control panel .#@#double-click the Printers or Printers and Fax icon .#@#right-click on the Printer you wish to test and click Properties .#@#if you do not see you printer list you printer be not install .#@#in the Printers Properties window click the print test Page button .#@#if the printer be able to print a test page , you be printer be install and setup properly .#@#however , if you be unable to print in other program it be possible that the program you be attempt to print from have issue .#@#older version of Windows with older printer .#@#if you be run a older printer and ms-do , Windows 3 .#@#x , Windows 95 , Windows 98 , or Windows NT , you can also attempt the below software test .#@#get to a ms-do prompt or Windows command line .#@#get to the root directory - type : cd \ Reroute dir to printer - type : dir > lpt1 .#@#the above should take the directory listing and print to the printer .#@#if this do not print , refer to you operating system troubleshoot section .#@#Extra note : this will not paper feed , therefore press you ff or pp , or manually eject the paper .

20	ch000689	0	Computer turns off without warning	Heat related issue .  A computer that turns off without warning is usually caused by a heat related issue. Many computers today are designed to turn off automatically if the computer, processor, or other device gets too hot. Start by verifying the fan on the power supply is working by examining the back of the computer and seeing if the fan is moving and moving smoothly. For all other fans in the computer, you will need to open the computer and make sure the fan are working. While in the computer example the processor fan ( heatsink ), video card fans, and case fans . If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this is also a common indication of a fan failure. Tip: While inside the computer it may also be a good idea to clean the inside of the computer . Dust, dirt, hair, and other residue in the vents and on the fans can prevent proper air flow and heat the computer. Tip: If your BIOS monitors the RPM of the fans, enter BIOS and make sure the BIOS does not report any errors. Software utilities such as SpeedFan can also be used to help monitor fans in your computer. While inside the computer, it's also a good idea to verify the processor heatsink is properly connected by disconnecting and reconnecting the heatsink. If the processor heatsink is not properly attached or does not have a proper amount of thermal compound, the computer will overheat. Caution: If you do remove the processor heatsink the thermal compound on the processor and heatsink should be cleaned and new thermal compound should be applied. Not reapplying new thermal compound could make issues worse since the bond between the CPU and heatsink would be broken. Is there a way to tell how hot my CPU is running? What should be the temperature of my processor?	heat related issue .#@#a computer that turn off without warning be usually cause by a heat related issue .#@#many computer today be design to turn off automatically if the computer , processor , or other device get too hot .#@#Start by verify the fan on the power supply be work by examine the back of the computer and see if the fan be move and move smoothly .#@#for all other fan in the computer , you will need to open the computer and make sure the fan be work .#@#while in the computer example the processor fan -lrb- heatsink -rrb- , video card fan , and case fan .#@#if you have hear any abnormal noise come from you computer recently such as a high squealing , this be also a common indication of a fan failure .#@#tip : while inside the computer it may also be a good idea to clean the inside of the computer .#@#dust , dirt , hair , and other residue in the vent and on the fan can prevent proper air flow and heat the computer .#@#tip : if you bio monitor the rpm of the fan , enter bio and make sure the bio do not report any error .#@#Software utility such as SpeedFan can also be use to help monitor fan in you computer .#@#while inside the computer , it be also a good idea to verify the processor heatsink be properly connect by disconnect and reconnect the heatsink .#@#if the processor heatsink be not properly attach or do not have a proper amount of thermal compound , the computer will overheat .#@#caution : if you do remove the processor heatsink the thermal compound on the processor and heatsink should be clean and new thermal compound should be apply .#@#not reapply new thermal compound could make issue worse since the bond between the CPU and heatsink would be break .#@#be there a way to tell how hot my CPU be run ?#@#what should be the temperature of my processor ?

20	ch000689	1	Computer turns off without warning	Hardware issue or error .  Any failing hardware component in your computer could cause your computer to unexpectedly turn off without warning. If you have recently added any new hardware remove it from the computer to make sure it is not causing the problem. Tip: Before attempting to remove any hardware, make sure you are not encountering this issue because of hardware conflicts by checking Device Manager for errors . If you have not recently installed any new hardware into the computer, the next best solution to determining if this is a hardware issue would be remove any hardware on the computer that is not needed. For example, remove your modem, network card, sound card, and any other expansion cards that are not needed for the computer to operate.

25	ch000445	1	Basic network troubleshooting	Verify connections .  Wired Network .  If this is a wired network, verify that the network cable is properly connected and make sure the LEDs next to the network jack are properly illuminated. For example, a network card with a solid green LED or light usually indicates that the card is either connected or receiving a signal. If the green light is flashing, this is an indication of data being sent or received. In the picture to the right, is an example of LAN port with two LED indicators next to the RJ-45 port. With this port, one LED will light up if connected properly and the other will flash when transmitting data. If there are no lights or the lights are orange or red .  the card may be bad, not connected properly, or that the card is not receiving a signal from the network. If you are on a small or local network and have the capability of checking a hub , switch , or router verify that the cables are properly connected and that it has power. If after checking the connections the LED indicators appear bad, the network adapter, port, or cable may be defective. Wireless Network .  If you're using a laptop with a wireless network make sure if the laptop has a Wi-Fi button that it is turned on. Many laptops will have a Wi-Fi button that allows the wireless network to be turned on and off. In the picture to the right, is an example of a Wi-Fi button that is currently enabled. If the Wi-Fi button is turned on, make sure you're connecting to the correct Wi-Fi hotspot by right-clicking on the Network icon in the Windows notification area and clicking "Connect to a network". Usually, the network with the strongest connection (the most bars) will be your wireless router. Finally, when connecting to most wireless networks you will need to enter the proper SSID (password) in order to connect to the network. If the incorrect SSID has been entered you will be denied access to the network.	verify connection .#@#wire Network .#@#if this be a wire network , verify that the network cable be properly connect and make sure the led next to the network jack be properly illuminate .#@#for example , a network card with a solid green led or light usually indicate that the card be either connect or receive a signal .#@#if the green light be flash , this be a indication of datum be send or receive .#@#in the picture to the right , be a example of LAN port with two lead indicator next to the rj-45 port .#@#with this port , one led will light up if connect properly and the other will flash when transmit datum .#@#if there be no light or the light be orange or red .#@#the card may be bad , not connect properly , or that the card be not receive a signal from the network .#@#if you be on a small or local network and have the capability of check a hub , switch , or router verify that the cable be properly connect and that it have power .#@#if after check the connection the LED indicator appear bad , the network adapter , port , or cable may be defective .#@#Wireless Network .#@#if you be use a laptop with a wireless network make sure if the laptop have a wi-fi button that it be turn on .#@#many laptop will have a wi-fi button that allow the wireless network to be turn on and off .#@#in the picture to the right , be a example of a wi-fi button that be currently enable .#@#if the wi-fi button be turn on , make sure you be connect to the correct Wi-Fi hotspot by right-click on the Network icon in the Windows notification area and click `` connect to a network '' .#@#usually , the network with the strongest connection -lrb- the most bar -rrb- will be you wireless router .#@#finally , when connect to most wireless network you will need to enter the proper ssid -lrb- password -rrb- in order to connect to the network .#@#if the incorrect ssid have be enter you will be deny access to the network .

25	ch000445	3	Basic network troubleshooting	Connect to the router .  If all of the above steps have been checked and your network has a router , make sure the computer can connect to the router by performing the below commands. Determine the routers address .  Using the ipconfig command (or ifconfig command for Linux) determine the router's address by looking at the Gateway address. Below are the steps for Microsoft Windows users, Linux users can substitute ipconfig for ifconfig. Open the Windows command line. From the command prompt type ipconfig and press enter. This command should give you an output similar to the below example. Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection: Connection-specific DNS Suffix . : computerhope.com. IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.103 Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0 .  Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1 .  The Default Gateway is the address of your router. Most home routers will have a gateway address that starts with 192.168 like the address shown above. Assuming your gateway address is 192.168.1.1 attempt to ping the router to see if it can send and receive information by running the below command. If you get replies back from the router, the connection between your router and computer are good, and you can skip to the next step . If you do not receive any replies back from the router either the router is not setup properly or your connection between the router and the computer are not correct. Reset your router to make sure it is not a problem with your router by following the below steps. Turn off the power to the computer and leave it off. Unplug the power to your router and cable modem or DSL modem . Leave the power cables disconnected for 10-15 seconds and then plug in your modem and then your router again. Finally, turn on your computer again and repeat this step to see if you can ping your router. If you're using a wireless network and have followed all the above steps and still are unable to ping the router try turning off the computer again and connect the computer to the router using a cable instead of trying to connect using wireless. If a wire does also not work connect the manufacturer of the router for additional support or replacement.	connect to the router .#@#if all of the above step have be check and you network have a router , make sure the computer can connect to the router by perform the below command .#@#determine the router address .#@#use the ipconfig command -lrb- or ifconfig command for linux -rrb- determine the router 's address by look at the Gateway address .#@#Below be the step for Microsoft Windows user , linux user can substitute ipconfig for ifconfig .#@#open the Windows command line .#@#from the command prompt type ipconfig and press enter .#@#this command should give you a output similar to the below example .#@#Ethernet adapter local area connection : connection-specific dn suffix .#@#: computerhope.com .#@#IP Address ... ... .#@#.#@#: 192.168.1.103 subnet mask ... ... .#@#: 255.255.255.0 .#@#Default Gateway ... ... : 192.168.1.1 .#@#the Default Gateway be the address of you router .#@#most home router will have a gateway address that start with 192.168 like the address show above .#@#assume you gateway address be 192.168.1.1 attempt to ping the router to see if it can send and receive information by run the below command .#@#if you get reply back from the router , the connection between you router and computer be good , and you can skip to the next step .#@#if you do not receive any reply back from the router either the router be not setup properly or you connection between the router and the computer be not correct .#@#reset you router to make sure it be not a problem with you router by follow the below step .#@#turn off the power to the computer and leave it off .#@#unplug the power to you router and cable modem or dsl modem .#@#leave the power cable disconnect for 10-15 seconds and then plug in you modem and then you router again .#@#finally , turn on you computer again and repeat this step to see if you can ping you router .#@#if you be use a wireless network and have follow all the above step and still be unable to ping the router try turn off the computer again and connect the computer to the router use a cable instead of try to connect use wireless .#@#if a wire do also not work connect the manufacturer of the router for additional support or replacement .

25	ch000445	5	Basic network troubleshooting	Internet is not working .  If you're able to ping the router, but are still unable to connect to the Internet, either your router is improperly configured or the ISP is having issues. Note: Some ISPs such as Comcast require special software be installed. Make sure any software included with your Modem or other hardware has been installed on at least one computer if you are setting up a new Internet connection. If your Internet has been working but recently stopped working, give it a few minutes to make sure it is not a temporary outage. If after waiting a few minutes, you still have problems and you have not disconnected the power to your router and modem already follow the below steps. Turn off the power to the computer and leave it off. Unplug the power to your router and cable modem or DSL modem . Leave the power cables disconnected for 10-15 seconds and then plug in your modem and then your router again. Finally, turn on your computer again and repeat this step to see if you can ping your router.   If after following the above steps the Internet is still not working, open the Windows command line and run the below command. Running the above command should get a reply from Google. If you get a reply, this is an indication that the Internet is working, but you may be encountering a problem with the Internet browser you are using to browse the Internet. Try an alternative browser such as Firefox or Chrome . If you're getting no reply from Google, your router or modem is not reaching the Internet. If you have a router, make sure your router has DHCP enabled and that the WAN or Gateway address is the proper ISP address. Finally, after verifying all of the above settings if your Internet is still not working we suggest contacting the ISP to make sure it is not a problem on their end and to assist you further with any special configurations that may not be mentioned in this document.	internet be not work .#@#if you be able to ping the router , but be still unable to connect to the internet , either you router be improperly configure or the isp be have issue .#@#note : some isp such as Comcast require special software be install .#@#make sure any software include with you modem or other hardware have be install on at least one computer if you be set up a new internet connection .#@#if you internet have be work but recently stop work , give it a few minute to make sure it be not a temporary outage .#@#if after wait a few minute , you still have problem and you have not disconnect the power to you router and modem already follow the below step .#@#turn off the power to the computer and leave it off .#@#unplug the power to you router and cable modem or dsl modem .#@#leave the power cable disconnect for 10-15 seconds and then plug in you modem and then you router again .#@#finally , turn on you computer again and repeat this step to see if you can ping you router .#@#if after follow the above step the internet be still not work , open the Windows command line and run the below command .#@#run the above command should get a reply from Google .#@#if you get a reply , this be a indication that the internet be work , but you may be encounter a problem with the internet browser you be use to browse the internet .#@#try a alternative browser such as Firefox or Chrome .#@#if you be get no reply from Google , you router or modem be not reach the internet .#@#if you have a router , make sure you router have dhcp enable and that the WAN or Gateway address be the proper isp address .#@#finally , after verify all of the above setting if you internet be still not work we suggest contact the isp to make sure it be not a problem on they end and to assist you further with any special configuration that may not be mention in this document .

25	ch000445	6	Basic network troubleshooting	Additional troubleshooting .  Another method of determining network issues is to use the tracert command if you are a Windows user or the traceroute command if you are a Linux or Unix variant user. This command will give you an overview of each of the devices (routers) a packet travels ( hops ) over a network and can give you an idea of where a problem exists in your network or outside of your network. To use this command you must be at the command line and type one of the below commands depending on your operating system. or .  If run successfully you should begin to see each hop between the computer and network devices.

26	ch000186	1	How to erase my hard drive and start over	Windows NT 4.0 users .  Windows NT can be installed several different ways. We recommend that Windows NT be installed using the below steps as we feel that these steps by far are the easiest way to install Windows NT 4.0. First, we recommend that all users wanting to install Windows NT use the /b switch, which allows the users to not need to create the diskettes. We do, however, recommend that the user create the Emergency recover diskettes if they have not already been created after the installation of Windows NT. Finally, before the installation of Windows NT, it is recommended that you run SMARTDRV, which will help the installation of Windows NT run a lot faster. Place the CD into the computer. Type X: (where x is the CD-ROM drive, often this is D:). Once at the appropriate drive, type CD WINNT and press enter to get into the Windows 95 directory. Once at X:\WINNT> Type winnt /b. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

65	ccri.txt	1	The Printer is not printing	Check to see if you can print a Windows test page The windows test page is a basic communication test between your computer and the printer. To print a Windows test page: Left mouse-click on the Start button. Go to Settings and then select Printers. Inside the printer window, you should see a small printer icon with the name of printer you are trying to print to. Place your mouse arrow on the small printer icon and right mouse-click. A small gray window should appear and the last choice in the box is Properties. Left mouse-click on Properties. A printer window with several tabs should appear. On the General tab, there is a Print Test Page button in the lower right corner. Left mouse-click on the button.

159	imperial-college.txt	8	Speeding up a Slow Computer	Defragment Your Hard Disk Over time, data becomes scattered across your hard disk as it is written, read, and deleted. This can slow down your computer as it takes additional time to find and read the necessary data. By running the disk defragmenter, the data is consolidated in one location and related data is placed near to each other.

The most common hardware upgrade is memory (RAM). Adding more memory can speed up your computer quite a bit, and it's relatively cheap. It may also be necessary to replace your computer with a new one, as it becomes unfeasible to upgrade very old machines continuously or after several years.

159	imperial-college.txt	10	Speeding up a Slow Computer	Reinstall Windows Windows can become slow and develop problems after years of use on the same machine. Security updates and patches are applied, programs are installed and uninstalled, and settings are modified regularly. It is therefore a good idea to wipe the hard drive and reinstall Windows from scratch, back to its optimum configuration and performance. Doing this after around three to four years of use may give a noticeable speed improvement. When reinstalling Windows from scratch, it is important to backup any data you have stored on the hard drive, as well as making a note of the programs you would like reinstalled. Please speak to a member of DIDE IT if you think the time has come for your machine to be wiped and setup with a fresh installation of Windows (which will normally be the latest version of Windows).

190	mac.txt	4	Connecting to the Internet	Check your connections and access Make sure that all of your Ethernet or phone cable connections are secure. Check the connection to your computer, the modem, and to any hub, router, or wireless base station you may be using. Try swapping your cable with another to rule out any faulty cable issues. If you're connecting wirelessly, make sure that the wireless network is up and running and that you actually have access to that network—you may need a password or need to be added to an access control list by your MAC address (aka AirPort ID). For more information about joining an encrypted wireless network, see AirPort, Time Capsule: Joining an encrypted wireless network. If you connect to the Internet using a corporate or enterprise network (such as if you're at work) and can't access certain webpages or sites, the network may have a firewall that is preventing you from doing so.

If so, your computer may have a video issue instead. Check your display to make sure that it's working properly. Try turning up the brightness on the display itself (for portable computers press and hold F2 for 3-4 seconds). If you stick your eyeball up close to it and can just make out your desktop image, you may need to get your display serviced.

If you connected your device to a USB or FireWire hub or to a port on another USB or FireWire device that's connected to your Mac (known as daisy chaining), connect your device directly to a port on your computer. Some devices need to draw power from a USB or FireWire port to work; if you connect a device to a non-powered hub (one that isn't plugged in to a power source) or to a low-power port (such as the one on your USB keyboard), it may not work. If you have another known-good cable, try swapping the cable to see if that works.

198	mac.txt	0	Burning a disc	If a burn does not succeed, check the disc or try another disc Eject the disc from the drive and inspect it to see if the surface is dirty or scratched, or if it already has data written on it (the shiny surface is slightly darker where data has already been burned). If it's dirty, wipe it clean with a soft, damp cloth and try burning again. If the disc already contains data, try another disc. If you're using a rewritable disc that already contains data, be sure to erase it before burning data on it again. Small flaws or surface inconsistencies can cause an unsuccessful burn.

248	microsoft.txt	2	Why did the wrong channel record?	Windows Media Center might have attempted to tune to a channel that is not part of your TV service package. In some cases, the automatic behavior of some set-top boxes affects how Windows Media Center can control the set-top box. When Windows Media Center tunes to a channel that is not part of your TV service package, the set-top box might instead change to a default channel, display an on-screen message, remain on the last viewed channel, or change to the closest viewable channel in the listings. In all cases, the set-top box performs a default action that causes Windows Media Center to get out of sync and record the wrong channel. You can prevent Windows Media Center from trying to access and record channels that you do not subscribe to by hiding unwanted channels. To hide channels that are not included in your TV service package On the start screen, scroll to Tasks, click settings, click TV, click Guide, and then click Edit Channels. Use the arrow buttons on the screen to scroll through the list and locate the channels that you want to show or hide. As you click each channel, the inset window displays that channel. Select or clear the check box next to each channel. When a check box is selected, the channel appears in the Guide; when a check box is cleared, the channel does not appear. Click Save to return to the Guide settings screen.

If you test your Internet connection and receive a "Test failed" notification when setting up Windows Media Center or downloading Guide listings, try the following:	Check the firewall or proxy settings for your default Internet connection. If you connect to the Internet through a proxy server or a firewall, make sure that all ports are configured to enable connections by Windows Media Center. Depending on what type of network you use, these settings might vary from person to person. If you are not sure what the correct proxy server or firewall settings are, you might need to contact either your network administrator or your Internet service provider (ISP).

In some cases, that type of tuner hardware cannot receive FM radio at the same time as it receives a TV signal. For example, if the tuner is in use for FM radio when Windows Media Center is scheduled to start a recording, a warning appears that the FM radio session will be stopped when the TV recording starts. If you do not make a selection, Windows Media Center automatically stops FM radio and begins recording TV, as scheduled.

290	microsoft.txt	1	I added my scanner to the computer but I can't select it when I use Windows Fax and Scan or Windows Photo Gallery.	If a driver is not available or if you've updated the driver and still can't select the scanner, find out if your scanner uses TWAIN technology. TWAIN is an application programming interface (API) that is used to import images from scanners and digital cameras to your computer. Windows Photo Gallery and Windows Fax and Scan use a different technology, called the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) API, and do not work with TWAIN scanners. If your scanner uses TWAIN technology, you might need to use the program that came with your scanner instead of using Windows Fax and Scan or Windows Photo Gallery. To find out if your scanner uses TWAIN technology, check the information that came with the scanner or contact the scanner manufacturer.	if a driver be not available or if you have update the driver and still can not select the scanner , find out if you scanner use TWAIN technology .#@#twain be a application programming interface -lrb- apus -rrb- that be use to import image from scanner and digital camera to you computer .#@#Windows Photo Gallery and Windows Fax and scan use a different technology , call the Windows image acquisition -lrb- wium -rrb- apus , and do not work with twain scanner .#@#if you scanner use TWAIN technology , you might need to use the program that come with you scanner instead of use Windows Fax and scan or Windows Photo Gallery .#@#to find out if you scanner use TWAIN technology , check the information that come with the scanner or contact the scanner manufacturer .
