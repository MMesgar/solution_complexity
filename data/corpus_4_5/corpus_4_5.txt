13	ch000726	0	Not a valid Win32 application	File is corrupt, bad, or missing .  If the file or program you're attempting to run is corrupt or missing, Windows will be unable to execute the file properly and sometimes generate this error message. Download files .  If you downloaded this file and verified it is complete and compatible with your version of Windows , delete the file and try downloading and running it again. It's possible during the download that the file became corrupted. Finally, if the second download does not work, try downloading the file from a different webpage. It is possible that the person or company maintaining the website mistakenly uploaded a corrupt version of the file you're attempting download. Installing a program from a CD or other disk .  If you're attempting to install a program and are getting this error, verify that the CD is clean . If the CD is dirty or bad, you could get this error during the install or after the program has been installed because it was not copied properly onto the computer. Running a program from the computer .  If you're running the program from a shortcut on the computer, verify that the program is still on the computer. In some cases if the program is no longer installed on the computer you may get this error. If the hard drive is corrupted or bad it can also cause working programs to fail either because not all the data can be read from the hard drive or because the program has become corrupted while on the drive. Run scandisk and defrag on the hard drive to check for any potential errors. Long file name issue .  Make sure the program or file you're attempting to run does not contain the same name as the long file name directory it is contained in. For example, executing a file named "program" in the "program files" directory can cause errors in some versions of Windows. Additionally, if you're attempting to install a program and after the install the program does not work, you may also want to try installing the program in a different directory . Bad file .  Any file can be changed or renamed to be a .exe file. If you're downloading the file, make sure the file is supposed to be a .exe file and that it's not being changed. If you're attempting to create a .exe, file make sure you're compiling the file for Windows and never just rename a file to a .exe file. For example, renaming a .bat file to a .exe file will not make the file an executable file. For a file to become an executable file it needs to either be compiled or converted through a software program designed to convert the file.	file be corrupt , bad , or miss .#@#if the file or program you be attempt to run be corrupt or missing , Windows will be unable to execute the file properly and sometimes generate this error message .#@#download file .#@#if you download this file and verify it be complete and compatible with you version of Windows , delete the file and try downloading and run it again .#@#it be possible during the download that the file become corrupt .#@#finally , if the second download do not work , try download the file from a different webpage .#@#it be possible that the person or company maintain the website mistakenly upload a corrupt version of the file you be attempt download .#@#install a program from a cd or other disk .#@#if you be attempt to install a program and be get this error , verify that the CD be clean .#@#if the CD be dirty or bad , you could get this error during the install or after the program have be install because it be not copy properly onto the computer .#@#run a program from the computer .#@#if you be run the program from a shortcut on the computer , verify that the program be still on the computer .#@#in some case if the program be no longer install on the computer you may get this error .#@#if the hard drive be corrupt or bad it can also cause work program to fail either because not all the datum can be read from the hard drive or because the program have become corrupt while on the drive .#@#Run scandisk and defrag on the hard drive to check for any potential error .#@#long file name issue .#@#make sure the program or file you be attempt to run do not contain the same name as the long file name directory it be contain in .#@#for example , execute a file name `` program '' in the `` program file '' directory can cause error in some version of Windows .#@#additionally , if you be attempt to install a program and after the install the program do not work , you may also want to try install the program in a different directory .#@#bad file .#@#any file can be change or rename to be a .#@#exe file .#@#if you be download the file , make sure the file be suppose to be a .#@#exe file and that it be not be change .#@#if you be attempt to create a .#@#exe , file make sure you be compile the file for Windows and never just rename a file to a .#@#exe file .#@#for example , rename a .#@#bat file to a .#@#exe file will not make the file a executable file .#@#for a file to become a executable file it need to either be compile or convert through a software program design to convert the file .
