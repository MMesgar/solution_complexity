8	ch000208	1	Missing or lost sound in Windows	Verify the installed driver settings .  Open the Windows Device Manager .  Verify there are no conflicts or errors listed anywhere in Device Manager. If conflicts exist skip down to conflicts section . Verify no other devices are listed. If other devices are listed skip down to other devices section . Verify that your "Sound, video and game controllers" category is listed, if not skip down to the missing sound card section . If no conflicts or other devices are listed and your sound card is listed with no conflicts, skip to the next section . Conflicts section .  If conflicts exists with your sound card or other devices installed in your computer it is likely that either the drivers are not properly installed for that device or the sound card or other devices are conflicting. If you open the properties of the device that is conflicting and view the properties, additional details about the conflict can be found. Additional information about error codes as well as help with Device Manager can be found on our Device Manager section . If you are unable to locate additional information about your issue or are unable to resolve the issue, follow the below steps. Under Sound, Video and game controllers highlight each device and press the delete key to remove the device. Reboot the computer. As the computer is booting the system will detect the sound card and any of it's devices and re-install those devices. If prompted for a location of drivers, try pointing it to your sound card CD or your Windows CD. If this does not work or is unable to locate the proper files, you will need to get the latest sound drivers from your sound card manufacturer. Other devices section .  If other devices are listed, it is possible that these other devices could be the sound card or other devices conflicting with the sound card. If any other devices are listed it is recommended you remove those devices, reboot the computer and let Windows redetect the devices. If this does not work, determine what device is not being detected and resolve that issue first. Missing sound card section. If you are missing the "Sound, video and game controllers" category in Device Manager, it is likely that the sound card drivers are not installed properly, sound card has been disabled, sound card is bad, or no sound card is available in the computer. First, verify no conflicts or other devices are present in the Device Manager; if these are present it is likely they are the sound card or devices causing the sound card not to be detected. Second, verify that the computer has a sound card and that the sound card is enabled on the computer. If this is an on-board sound card you can verify that it is enabled in CMOS setup . If you have no adapters or cannot click the down arrow to select the correct adapter, close out of this Window. In Control Panel double-click the System icon, click the Device Manager tab within Device Manager and ensure there are no yellow ! or red X. If you have either of these on any of your sound devices, remove everything under Sound Video game controllers and reboot the computer. If after rebooting the computer you still have the same conflicts, double-click on the conflicting device and refer to our Device Manager error code section giving you additional information on the error code you are experiencing.	verify the install driver setting .#@#open the Windows Device Manager .#@#verify there be no conflict or error list anywhere in Device Manager .#@#if conflict exist skip down to conflict section .#@#verify no other device be list .#@#if other device be list skip down to other device section .#@#verify that you `` sound , video and game controller '' category be list , if not skip down to the miss sound card section .#@#if no conflict or other device be list and you sound card be list with no conflict , skip to the next section .#@#conflict section .#@#if conflict exist with you sound card or other device install in you computer it be likely that either the driver be not properly install for that device or the sound card or other device be conflict .#@#if you open the property of the device that be conflict and view the property , additional detail about the conflict can be find .#@#additional information about error code as well as help with Device Manager can be find on we Device Manager section .#@#if you be unable to locate additional information about you issue or be unable to resolve the issue , follow the below step .#@#under sound , Video and game controller highlight each device and press the delete key to remove the device .#@#reboot the computer .#@#as the computer be boot the system will detect the sound card and any of it be device and re-install those device .#@#if prompt for a location of driver , try point it to you sound card cd or you Windows CD .#@#if this do not work or be unable to locate the proper file , you will need to get the latest sound driver from you sound card manufacturer .#@#other device section .#@#if other device be list , it be possible that these other device could be the sound card or other device conflict with the sound card .#@#if any other device be list it be recommend you remove those device , reboot the computer and let Windows redetect the device .#@#if this do not work , determine what device be not be detect and resolve that issue first .#@#miss sound card section .#@#if you be miss the `` sound , video and game controller '' category in Device Manager , it be likely that the sound card driver be not install properly , sound card have be disabled , sound card be bad , or no sound card be available in the computer .#@#first , verify no conflict or other device be present in the Device Manager ; if these be present it be likely they be the sound card or device cause the sound card not to be detect .#@#second , verify that the computer have a sound card and that the sound card be enable on the computer .#@#if this be a on-board sound card you can verify that it be enable in CMOS setup .#@#if you have no adapter or can not click the down arrow to select the correct adapter , close out of this window .#@#in Control Panel double-click the System icon , click the Device Manager tab within Device Manager and ensure there be no yellow !#@#or red x .#@#if you have either of these on any of you sound device , remove everything under sound Video game controller and reboot the computer .#@#if after reboot the computer you still have the same conflict , double-click on the conflict device and refer to we Device Manager error code section give you additional information on the error code you be experience .

13	ch000726	0	Not a valid Win32 application	File is corrupt, bad, or missing .  If the file or program you're attempting to run is corrupt or missing, Windows will be unable to execute the file properly and sometimes generate this error message. Download files .  If you downloaded this file and verified it is complete and compatible with your version of Windows , delete the file and try downloading and running it again. It's possible during the download that the file became corrupted. Finally, if the second download does not work, try downloading the file from a different webpage. It is possible that the person or company maintaining the website mistakenly uploaded a corrupt version of the file you're attempting download. Installing a program from a CD or other disk .  If you're attempting to install a program and are getting this error, verify that the CD is clean . If the CD is dirty or bad, you could get this error during the install or after the program has been installed because it was not copied properly onto the computer. Running a program from the computer .  If you're running the program from a shortcut on the computer, verify that the program is still on the computer. In some cases if the program is no longer installed on the computer you may get this error. If the hard drive is corrupted or bad it can also cause working programs to fail either because not all the data can be read from the hard drive or because the program has become corrupted while on the drive. Run scandisk and defrag on the hard drive to check for any potential errors. Long file name issue .  Make sure the program or file you're attempting to run does not contain the same name as the long file name directory it is contained in. For example, executing a file named "program" in the "program files" directory can cause errors in some versions of Windows. Additionally, if you're attempting to install a program and after the install the program does not work, you may also want to try installing the program in a different directory . Bad file .  Any file can be changed or renamed to be a .exe file. If you're downloading the file, make sure the file is supposed to be a .exe file and that it's not being changed. If you're attempting to create a .exe, file make sure you're compiling the file for Windows and never just rename a file to a .exe file. For example, renaming a .bat file to a .exe file will not make the file an executable file. For a file to become an executable file it needs to either be compiled or converted through a software program designed to convert the file.	file be corrupt , bad , or miss .#@#if the file or program you be attempt to run be corrupt or missing , Windows will be unable to execute the file properly and sometimes generate this error message .#@#download file .#@#if you download this file and verify it be complete and compatible with you version of Windows , delete the file and try downloading and run it again .#@#it be possible during the download that the file become corrupt .#@#finally , if the second download do not work , try download the file from a different webpage .#@#it be possible that the person or company maintain the website mistakenly upload a corrupt version of the file you be attempt download .#@#install a program from a cd or other disk .#@#if you be attempt to install a program and be get this error , verify that the CD be clean .#@#if the CD be dirty or bad , you could get this error during the install or after the program have be install because it be not copy properly onto the computer .#@#run a program from the computer .#@#if you be run the program from a shortcut on the computer , verify that the program be still on the computer .#@#in some case if the program be no longer install on the computer you may get this error .#@#if the hard drive be corrupt or bad it can also cause work program to fail either because not all the datum can be read from the hard drive or because the program have become corrupt while on the drive .#@#Run scandisk and defrag on the hard drive to check for any potential error .#@#long file name issue .#@#make sure the program or file you be attempt to run do not contain the same name as the long file name directory it be contain in .#@#for example , execute a file name `` program '' in the `` program file '' directory can cause error in some version of Windows .#@#additionally , if you be attempt to install a program and after the install the program do not work , you may also want to try install the program in a different directory .#@#bad file .#@#any file can be change or rename to be a .#@#exe file .#@#if you be download the file , make sure the file be suppose to be a .#@#exe file and that it be not be change .#@#if you be attempt to create a .#@#exe , file make sure you be compile the file for Windows and never just rename a file to a .#@#exe file .#@#for example , rename a .#@#bat file to a .#@#exe file will not make the file a executable file .#@#for a file to become a executable file it need to either be compile or convert through a software program design to convert the file .

14	ch000605	0	Windows restarts without warning	Software issue or error .  With the introduction of Windows XP Microsoft designed Windows to automatically reboot each time an error occurs such as a BSoD . Although this may be nice for errors that do not occur often, users who have a re-occurring error may wish to identify the error to troubleshoot it. Below are the steps on how this feature can be disabled and enabled in Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8. From the Desktop .  right-click on My Computer . Click the Properties option. In the System Properties window click the Advanced .  tab or the Advanced system settings link. In Advanced click the Settings .  button under Startup and Recovery . In the Startup and Recovery window uncheck the Automatically restart check box. Click Ok. Now if the computer generates an error it should not automatically restart and should display an error message, most likely a BSoD. How do I fix the Windows blue screen errors?

14	ch000605	1	Windows restarts without warning	Hardware issue or error .  Caution: Some of the below steps require you open your computer. While in the computer, be cautious of ESD . Any failing hardware component in your computer could cause your computer to unexpectedly generate an error or reboot without warning. If you have recently attempted to add a new hardware device, remove that device to make sure it is not causing your issues. Make sure you are not encountering any hardware conflicts by viewing Device Manager for errors . New drivers can also cause this issue, if you have recently performed any hardware driver updates you may wish to try an earlier version of the drivers. Additional information and help with computer drivers can be found on our drivers page . If you have updated drivers and removed any hardware that could be causing this issue and continue to experience random reboots, it's possible that the memory is bad in the computer. How can I test my memory to determine if it is bad? Finally, hardware devices that are not installed properly in the computer can also cause random reboots.

20	ch000689	0	Computer turns off without warning	Heat related issue .  A computer that turns off without warning is usually caused by a heat related issue. Many computers today are designed to turn off automatically if the computer, processor, or other device gets too hot. Start by verifying the fan on the power supply is working by examining the back of the computer and seeing if the fan is moving and moving smoothly. For all other fans in the computer, you will need to open the computer and make sure the fan are working. While in the computer example the processor fan ( heatsink ), video card fans, and case fans . If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this is also a common indication of a fan failure. Tip: While inside the computer it may also be a good idea to clean the inside of the computer . Dust, dirt, hair, and other residue in the vents and on the fans can prevent proper air flow and heat the computer. Tip: If your BIOS monitors the RPM of the fans, enter BIOS and make sure the BIOS does not report any errors. Software utilities such as SpeedFan can also be used to help monitor fans in your computer. While inside the computer, it's also a good idea to verify the processor heatsink is properly connected by disconnecting and reconnecting the heatsink. If the processor heatsink is not properly attached or does not have a proper amount of thermal compound, the computer will overheat. Caution: If you do remove the processor heatsink the thermal compound on the processor and heatsink should be cleaned and new thermal compound should be applied. Not reapplying new thermal compound could make issues worse since the bond between the CPU and heatsink would be broken. Is there a way to tell how hot my CPU is running? What should be the temperature of my processor?	heat related issue .#@#a computer that turn off without warning be usually cause by a heat related issue .#@#many computer today be design to turn off automatically if the computer , processor , or other device get too hot .#@#Start by verify the fan on the power supply be work by examine the back of the computer and see if the fan be move and move smoothly .#@#for all other fan in the computer , you will need to open the computer and make sure the fan be work .#@#while in the computer example the processor fan -lrb- heatsink -rrb- , video card fan , and case fan .#@#if you have hear any abnormal noise come from you computer recently such as a high squealing , this be also a common indication of a fan failure .#@#tip : while inside the computer it may also be a good idea to clean the inside of the computer .#@#dust , dirt , hair , and other residue in the vent and on the fan can prevent proper air flow and heat the computer .#@#tip : if you bio monitor the rpm of the fan , enter bio and make sure the bio do not report any error .#@#Software utility such as SpeedFan can also be use to help monitor fan in you computer .#@#while inside the computer , it be also a good idea to verify the processor heatsink be properly connect by disconnect and reconnect the heatsink .#@#if the processor heatsink be not properly attach or do not have a proper amount of thermal compound , the computer will overheat .#@#caution : if you do remove the processor heatsink the thermal compound on the processor and heatsink should be clean and new thermal compound should be apply .#@#not reapply new thermal compound could make issue worse since the bond between the CPU and heatsink would be break .#@#be there a way to tell how hot my CPU be run ?#@#what should be the temperature of my processor ?

issue a computer that turn off without warning be usually cause by a heat related issue many computer today be design to turn off automatically if the computer processor or other device get too hot start by verify the fan on the power supply be work by examine the back of the computer and see if the fan be move and move smoothly for all other fan in the computer you will need to open the computer and make sure the fan be work while in the computer example the processor fan -lrb- heatsink -rrb- video card fan and case fan if you have hear any abnormal noise come from you computer recently such as a high squealing this be also a common indication of a fan failure tip : while inside the computer it may also be a good idea to clean the inside of the computer dust dirt hair and other residue in the vent and on the fan can prevent proper air flow and heat the computer tip : if you bio monitor the rpm of the fan enter bio and make sure the bio do not report any error software utility such as speedfan can also be use to help monitor fan in you computer while inside the computer it be also a good idea to verify the processor heatsink be properly connect by disconnect and reconnect the heatsink if the processor heatsink be not properly attach or do not have a proper amount of thermal compound the computer will overheat caution : if you do remove the processor heatsink the thermal compound on the processor and heatsink should be clean and new thermal compound should be apply not reapply new thermal compound could make issue worse since the bond between the cpu and heatsink would be break be there a way to tell how hot my cpu be run ? what should be the temperature of my processor ?
20	ch000689	1	Computer turns off without warning	Hardware issue or error .  Any failing hardware component in your computer could cause your computer to unexpectedly turn off without warning. If you have recently added any new hardware remove it from the computer to make sure it is not causing the problem. Tip: Before attempting to remove any hardware, make sure you are not encountering this issue because of hardware conflicts by checking Device Manager for errors . If you have not recently installed any new hardware into the computer, the next best solution to determining if this is a hardware issue would be remove any hardware on the computer that is not needed. For example, remove your modem, network card, sound card, and any other expansion cards that are not needed for the computer to operate. Run the computer without these cards to see if they are the cause of your issue.	hardware issue or error .#@#any fail hardware component in you computer could cause you computer to unexpectedly turn off without warning .#@#if you have recently add any new hardware remove it from the computer to make sure it be not cause the problem .#@#tip : before attempt to remove any hardware , make sure you be not encounter this issue because of hardware conflict by check Device Manager for error .#@#if you have not recently install any new hardware into the computer , the next best solution to determine if this be a hardware issue would be remove any hardware on the computer that be not need .#@#for example , remove you modem , network card , sound card , and any other expansion card that be not need for the computer to operate .#@#Run the computer without these card to see if they be the cause of you issue .

22	ch000277	3	Basic floppy disk drive troubleshooting	Bad drivers .  If you are not able to read or write to a floppy diskette from Windows, verify that the computer is not exhibiting floppy drivers issues by testing the floppy drive from MS-DOS. If you are running Windows 3.x click File and click Exit Windows to get to an MS-DOS prompt. If you are running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT, Windows 2000, or Windows 2000 click Start, Shutdown, and Restart the computer to a MS-DOS prompt. Once at the prompt, place a diskette into the floppy disk drive and type format a: if you get: Invalid media or Track 0 Bad = Try formatting another floppy disk. Write Protect Error = Ensure that the disk is not write protected by removing the floppy disk and insuring that you cannot see through both holes; if you can, move the tab in the left hand side down (looking from the back of the floppy) and try again. If the disk is not write protected try another floppy disk. Invalid drive specification = Verify that you floppy drive is setup properly in CMOS Setup . If the floppy disk drive formats properly in MS-DOS but does not format in Windows, it is likely that Windows or a program within Windows is preventing the floppy drive from working. End task all running TSRs and background programs . If you continue to experience the same issues we recommend that Windows be reinstalled.	bad driver .#@#if you be not able to read or write to a floppy diskette from Windows , verify that the computer be not exhibit floppy driver issue by test the floppy drive from ms-do .#@#if you be run Windows 3 .#@#x click File and click exit Windows to get to a ms-do prompt .#@#if you be run Windows 95 , Windows 98 , Windows ME , Windows NT , Windows 2000 , or Windows 2000 click Start , Shutdown , and restart the computer to a ms-do prompt .#@#once at the prompt , place a diskette into the floppy disk drive and type format a : if you get : invalid media or Track 0 bad = try formatting another floppy disk .#@#write Protect error = ensure that the disk be not write protect by remove the floppy disk and insure that you can not see through both hole ; if you can , move the tab in the left hand side down -lrb- look from the back of the floppy -rrb- and try again .#@#if the disk be not write protected try another floppy disk .#@#invalid drive specification = Verify that you floppy drive be setup properly in CMOS Setup .#@#if the floppy disk drive format properly in ms-do but do not format in Windows , it be likely that Windows or a program within Windows be prevent the floppy drive from work .#@#end task all run tsr and background program .#@#if you continue to experience the same issue we recommend that Windows be reinstall .
